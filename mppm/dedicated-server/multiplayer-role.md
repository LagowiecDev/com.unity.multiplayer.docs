Use the [Dedicated Server package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.dedicated-server@1.0/manual/index.html) with Multiplayer Play Mode window to switch players between the server and client role.

To do this, set the [multiplayer role](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.dedicated-server@1.0/manual/multiplayer-roles.html) of each player to Client, Server, or Client and Server.

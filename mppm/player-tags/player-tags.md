Player Tags are similar to launch arguments for Players (both the Main Editor Player and Virtual Players) that you can use to configure Players to do things such as:

- Run as a client, server, or host automatically
- Automatically run as a member of a specific team (for example, “Red Team” or “Blue Team”)
- Move faster or slower to simulate their network connection

This section contains the following information:

2. [Configure Player tag](../player-tags/player-tags-configure)
3. [Attach a Player Tag to a virtual player](../virtual-players)
